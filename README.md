# Ruminations of a "Functional" Judoka

## What this braindump is really about
Over the years I've had numerous conversation with smart people in the Silicon Valley and outside of it about topics relating to functional programming with interesting outcomes. The majority of these conversations took place with highly educated software professionals with an impressive track record at world's leading technology companies. The fellow technologists were typically NOT functional programmers, although they often had a degree of exposure to the space. I often found it hard to formulate my ideas in a sufficiently concise way and to drive the point home to a sufficient degree. I found it especially challenging to address the question of the relative **perceived** unpopularity of functional programming when I would have expained some of its benefits. Thus I set out to write a few paragraphs and hopefully organize my thoughts better.
